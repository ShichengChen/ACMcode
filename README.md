# How to solve it
## from method side
- write every thing you have thought on the paper.
- write a formulation on the paper and try to optimize it.
- could I use brute force
- could I solve it by greedy and dp
- monotonically increasing or decreasing, binary search

### For math problems
- Factorization
- Enumerate from very beginning
- try to use formulation to change the form of equations

### For data structure problem
- find the maximum value from a range, try to use set first, then for RMQ or segment tree.

## from time side
- think about the Essence of the problem and details simultaneously.
- know how to write the code for EACH step. If i cannot remeber all situtation or form a big picture, I need to write to paper to organize the problem first and then write the code.
- test it well before write code
- never submit code continuously
- The limitation of one easy problem is 30 minutes during a contest
- The limitation of one hard problem is 1 day after contests(stop thinking if no more new ideas on this problem)

# How to write code faster
- find patterns in the string(D. Minimum Euler Cycle)[https://codeforces.com/contest/1334/problem/D]

# How to prevent wrong code
- write every requirement on the paper.
- make variables with relations have similar names.
- use small data test my solution
##How to debug faster
- use eyes first, then use cout one or few variables, then eyes then cout one or few variables etc.

## Small bugs
- int overflow
- small array size
- what if the size of array is 1(boundary situation)

## common mistakes
- Is greedy hold?[E. K-periodic Garland](https://codeforces.com/contest/1353/problem/E)


# How to consider thoroughly
- A is the aim, we may start from A, we should also consider not start from A[D. Orac and Medians](https://codeforces.com/contest/1350/problem/D) 


# If I encounter something
## If I encounter a wrong answer in first three problems or get wrong answer two times.
- relax, go out take shower or do somethings else.
- read the problem and code again.
- if cannot find the error, then go on to the next problem

## If I cannot solve the second or third problem.
- after 20 minutes, I should stop. I need to try to solve the fourth problem 


# Graph
- cycle
- multiple graphs
- multiple edges


# unsolved problem
- [CodeCraft-20 C. Primitive Primes](https://codeforces.com/contest/1316/problem/C)
	- enumerate from very beginning. 
- [Codeforces Round #629 F.Make k Equal](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/F) 
	- generate negtive results by mistake
	- watched test data
- [E. Quantifier Question](https://codeforces.com/contest/1345/problem/E)
	- understand problem description clearly

# How to win myself
- never stop thinking, like workout, train my brain every single day, at least a few minutes for each day.(do easy problem such as leetcode daily problem.)
