# Online judge code
- my online judge code

# How to solve it

## from method side
- could I use brute force
- could I solve it by greedy and dp
- monotonically increasing or decreasing, binary search
- write a formulation on the paper and try to optimize it.

## from time side
- first think about detail for 10-20 minutes and think of big picture of the problem(when i find a hard problem). think about the Essence of the problem.


# How to test my solution

- use small data
- test it well before write code

# How to prevent wrong code

- write every requirement on the paper.

# how to save time

- know how to write the code for EACH step and then begin to write code
- never submit code continuously

- if i cannot remeber all situtation or form a big picture, I need to write to paper to organize the problem first and then write the code.

- The limitation of one easy problem is 30 minutes during a contest

# Graph

- cycle
- multiple graphs
- multiple edges

# If I encounter a wrong answer in first three problems or get wrong answer two times.
- relax, go out take shower or do somethings else.
- read the problem and code again.
- if cannot find the error, then go on to the next problem
